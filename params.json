The adds the following functionality/capabilities to ReSA:\r\n- New extensions can be added.\r\n- Extensions are inheritable and thus extensible.\r\n- Extensions contain a parameter and visualization object and a handler to handle parameter updates from the view (a little like angular's '$scope').\r\n- Extensions are selected as a drop down list.\r\n- Extension parameters are automatically displayed on select.\r\n- Extension Visualizations are automatically loaded on select.\r\n- Visualizations are re-usable.\r\n- Visualizations are not limited to specific libraries (such as D3).\r\n- Extensions can define a guarded object to protect its parameters from mass assignment (Visualizations is the default guarded attribute).\r\n- Include location based filtering extension as proof of concept.\r\n- Source code documentation.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nLatest Node.js + NPM  \r\nLatest MongoDB  \r\nBower (get by running \"npm install -g bower\")\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\n\r\n1. Install required NodeJS modules:\r\n - npm install --save\r\n \r\n2. Install bower dependencies (see bower.json)\r\n - bower update\r\n\r\n3.

Execute `vagrant up` to init & start vagrant environment\r\n2. Once ready, connect to vagrant box using `vagrant ssh`\r\n3. Change to workdir with `cd /vagrant`\r\n4. (optional) Install ReSA-LodSaFE with `npm install`\r\n5. Run the app with `node app.js`\r\n6. Open vagrant host via 5.5.5.5:5555 in browser and see xReSA running (*see Vagrantfile)\r\n\r\n### Running (Without Vagrant)\r\n\r\n1. To start NodeJS server:\r\n - node app.js [port number (default port is 5555)]\r\n\r\n2.
